## 🔹 All Graphs & Results 

 Distribution of Daily Returns

   * Shape: Left-skewed
   * Insight: Majority of daily returns are low or near 0; few extreme negative values
   * Suggestion: This supports the use of a conservative model for short-term prediction.
     
 Pairplot (Open, High, Low, Close)

   * Insight: Features are strongly linearly related
   * Suggestion: Redundant variables may be dropped for modeling simplicity
